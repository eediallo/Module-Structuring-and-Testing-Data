const num = 56.4567;

// You should look up Math functions for this exercise https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math

// Create a variable called wholeNumberPart and assign to it an expression that evaluates to 56 ( the whole number part of num )
const wholeNumberPart = Math.floor(num);
console.log("whole number part", wholeNumberPart);
// Create a variable called decimalPart and assign to it an expression that evaluates to 0.4567 ( the decimal part of num )
const decimalPart = num - wholeNumberPart;
console.log("decimal part = ",decimalPart);
// Create a variable called roundedNum and assign to it an expression that evaluates to 57 ( num rounded to the nearest whole number )
const roundedNum = Math.ceil(num);
console.log("rounded number = ",roundedNum);
// Log your variables to the console to check your answers
